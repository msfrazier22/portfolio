								<p>I started graphic design during my freshman year of high school. I didn't know much about it, but I was fascinated with how I could use my creativity to make exactly what I wanted. We designed everything from shirts and hats, to calendars and buttons. I took graphic design classes throughout all four years of high school. When I went off to college, I majored in information technology because I was interested in learning about coding. The classes were a challenge, but I enjoyed learning how to build a website with coding. I didn't like it as much as graphic design though. Everything had to be exact with the coding and I felt like I couldn't express my creativity the way I wanted to. I decided to switch majors and now I am junior in college pursuing a bachelor's degree in graphic design.

								</p>
								<p>Currently, I am working on building my own brand to make a name for myself. I am also creating poster designs and logos at my current job to promote community events. Becoming a graphic designer was the best choice I have ever made because it's part of who I am. I enjoy having the freedom to bring my imagination into reality and put it on display for others. The feeling of helping other businesses with their brand by showcasing my skills brings me immense joy. I created this website to gain an opportunity to share my skills and to broaden my experience in graphic design. </p>
